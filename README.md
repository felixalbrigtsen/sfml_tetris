# sfml_tetris
A simple tetris clone written in C++, using SFML for graphics and input handling.

Mimics the feel of retro tetris.

# Install / Build

1. Install a c++ compiler, i used gcc on mac
2. Install [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and configure it to your system. Make sure it is added to path
3. Build with ``` make out ```
4. Execute with ``` ./tetris ```



I do not own the font or the SFML library.
